						<h2>Hello!</h2>
						<p>
							My name is Maegan Leigh Fasnacht. Previously known as Maegan the registered dental hygienist who decided
							she wanted to do something more with her life! In 2017 I decided to invest in something that I love, something
							that I’ve always wanted to do! Microblading not only changes the shape or size of the brow,
							it enhances your looks! It creates a boost in self esteem, and makes life a lot easier when you don’t
							have to worry about your brows smudging off after a workout, or a swim at the local pool. I love being creative,
							being an artist and helping people feel beautiful inside and out.

									<h3>What is Microblading?</h3>
									<p>This technique is a process that may be used to improve or create definition of the brow. Microblading
										can be used to cover gaps of lost hair, to extend the eyebrows, or may be used as a full reconstruction
										if the brows have little to no hair. Each microblading stroke is applied individually, allowing me to
										control the shape, color and density of the completed eyebrows.</p>
									<h3>What is a microblade?</h3>
									<p>Microblading is done with a tool called a microblade… it is a manual pen shaped tool that has a collection
										of tiny needles arranged in a specific way to help the artist create each, individual hair stroke. </p>

						<h2>Will it hurt?</h2>
						<p>
							Everyones pain tolerance is different, so it is hard to say if this procedure will hurt you.
							Before the microblading starts, every client is numbed with an agent for 20-30 minutes prior to
							starting. I would say 90% of clients feel little to no pain throughout the microblading session. Once
							the first pass (placing the outline of strokes into the skin) is complete, another numbing
							agent is placed onto the skin to make sure you are completely comfortable. For those that have
							felt a little discomfort have described the pain similar to a cat scratch, or scratching a sun burn.

								<h3>What can I expect for my first visit?</h3>
								<p>
									The first thing you would do Is fill out a
									short 2 page medical history form, as well as signing off on an informational sheet that
									will tell you all the risks that can occur from microblading. After that we would talk shape
									size and color for your brows. I will answer any and all questions you have, and look at any
									reference pictures you have for your new brows.
								</p>
								<p>
										Next is the pre-draw where I do some measurements for symmetry and make sure
									everything is to your liking then we blade you! Once you love your outline I
									will numb the area with topical for about 20-30 mins. After the skin is broken
									(after the first pass/strokes) I use another numbing agent, then on to the microblading!
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>
									The entire session with drawing and numbing and talking is about 2-2.5 hours.
									I will have you check your brows before you leave and make any changes you request,
									if necessary. An ointment will be placed on your brows and I will go over aftercare
									instructions before you leave.
								</p>
								<h3>How many appointments do I need and how long does it last?</h3>
								<p>
									Two sessions are needed to complete microblading. Strokes can fade up to 50% the first session,
									therefore a second session is important. The second session is scheduled 4-6 weeks out once the
									brows are completely healed. This is a semi permanent tattoo, so it can last between 12-18 months
									(depending on how well you take care of them). I recommend a touch up at least once a year to keep
									the color crisp, and the shape clean and defined.
								</p>
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<h3>Do I need to do anything different before my appointment?</h3>
								<p>
									Prior to your appointment there are some things you need to avoid. Alcohol causes excessive bleeding which
									pushes pigment out of the skin which will affect the retention of ink once the brows heal. I also suggest
									avoiding caffeine and blood thinners for the same reasons listed above! If botox, Retin-A, Glycolic acid or
									fillers of any kind are done prior to your appointment, please let me know so we can schedule accordingly.
